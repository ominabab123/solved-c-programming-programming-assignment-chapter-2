1. There are 2 programs to be written related to the material in Chapter 2. Be sure to refer to the “Green Sheet” and the Assignment sheet for chapter 1 for guidance for preparing the programs.2. The first program is Programming Problem 1 on page 88 in the textbook. This is a simple program that requires the use of string constant output statements.3. The second program is Programming Problem 4 on page 88.4. Turn in the following:– Printed copies of the 2 programs.– Printed copies of the output produced by the 2 programs.– A USB device containing the 2 programs.

###Assignment_2A

Problem 1 excerpted from page 88:

Write a program that prints out your course schedule for a single week. Here’s an example of the output for one day:

“`Monday 9:00 Computer Science 101Monday 11:00 Physics 201Monday 2:00 Dance 153“`Use named string constants wherever possible to avoid retyping any words or numbers.Be sure to include appropriate comments in your code, choose meaningful indentifiers, and use indentation as we do with the programs in this chapter.

###Assignment_2B

Problem 4 excerpted from page 88:

Write a program that prints out business cards for yourself. A card should include your name, street address, phone number(s), and email address. You also can make up a company name and put that on the card if you wish. To save paper, the program should print eight cards per page, arranged in two colums of four cards. To reduce typing, you should declare a named string constant for each line of the card, and then write output statements to print the eight cards using those constants. Be sure to include appropriate comments in your code, choose meaningful identifiers, and use indentation as we do with the programs in this chapter.
